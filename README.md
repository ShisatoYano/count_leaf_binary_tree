# count_leaf_binary_tree

* A node is a leaf node if both left and right child nodes of it are NULL.  
* If node is NULL then return 0.
* Else if left and right child nodes are NULL return 1.  
* Else recursively calculate leaf count of the tree using below formula.  
* Leaf count of a tree = Leaf count of left subtree + Leaf count of right subtree
